**Corporate Sustainability Dataset**
A comprehensive dataset encompassing 1,000 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) as of March 31, 2023, was compiled for this study. Data on these companies was meticulously collected from various sources to provide a holistic view of their sustainability practices. Public reports like Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reports (BRSRs) and annual reports served as primary sources of information. The NSE website provided a list of the 1,000 companies ranked by market capitalization, along with industry classifications crucial for analysis. To facilitate better data visualization, the 22 sectors were reclassified into 9 broader categories based on the National Industries Classification 2008 (NIC-2008). Additionally, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) website's Target Dashboard was used to identify companies with SBTi commitments. Financial data was collected from reliable financial websites like NSE, BSE, screener.in, and Trendlyne.com. The sample size of 1,000 aligns with the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) mandate for Business Responsibility Sustainability Reporting by the top 1,000 listed companies by market capitalization, ensuring the data reflects a representative sample of the Indian corporate landscape regarding sustainability practices. This rich dataset, encompassing information on corporate sustainability reports, financial data, and industry classifications, lays the groundwork for a thorough analysis of corporate sustainability practices in India.
